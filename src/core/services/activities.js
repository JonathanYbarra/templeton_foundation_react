    title: "Once again, the old problem of structuralism",
    description:
      "The problem of inter-theoretical relationships has been widely discussed in recent decades. The expectation of reaching the old unifying longing is built on the basis of a possible reduction between the theories from those idealizations where the limit tends to infinity. In the work we will analyze the problem of the classical limit. The main idea will be to address aspects related to the different idealizations to evaluate the reductionist pretensions.",
